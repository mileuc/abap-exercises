" Example: DO loop
" Letâ€™s assume input is "ABCD".
    " Initially, lv_len is set to 4 (the length of "ABCD").

    " First Iteration:
        " lv_len becomes 4 - 1 = 3.
        " lv_str+3(1) extracts the character 'D'.
        " result is updated to "D".

    " Second Iteration:
        " lv_len becomes 3 - 1 = 2.
        " lv_str+2(1) extracts the character 'C'.
        " result is updated to "DC".

    " Third Iteration:
        " lv_len becomes 2 - 1 = 1.
        " lv_str+1(1) extracts the character 'B'.
        " result is updated to "DCB".

    " Fourth Iteration:
        " lv_len becomes 1 - 1 = 0.
        " lv_str+0(1) extracts the character 'A'.
        " result is updated to "DCBA".

" After the loop completes, result contains the reversed string "DCBA"."
