ENDCLASS.  " End of class implementation

" Summary of implementation
" This method efficiently combines two internal tables (alphas and nums) by iterating over the rows, concatenating the corresponding fields, and producing a new internal table (combined_data). 
" Each row of combined_data contains concatenated values from both input tables, providing a quick and clear solution to the problem. 
" The use of table comprehensions and string templates makes the code concise and easy to read.
